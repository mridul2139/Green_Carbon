# <u> Green Carbon </u> 

This is a Streamlit web application that calculates carbon emissions based on different activities such as uploading, downloading, and deleting data. The emission factors used in the calculations are placeholder values and should be replaced with accurate data.
# <u> Motivation </u>
The motivation behind the Green Carbon Calculator project stems from our collective concern for the environment and the need for practical tools to promote carbon footprint awareness. As the digital age advances, so does our reliance on digital technologies and data management systems. However, the environmental impact of these technologies often goes unnoticed.

Our goal with this project is to raise awareness about the carbon emissions associated with common digital activities such as uploading, downloading, and deleting data. By providing users with a simple yet powerful tool to calculate their digital carbon footprint, we aim to encourage more sustainable practices in digital operations.

Through the Green Carbon Calculator, we hope to empower individuals, businesses, and organizations to make informed decisions about their digital activities and take steps towards reducing their overall environmental impact. By fostering a culture of environmental responsibility in the digital realm, we believe we can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future for all.

# <u> Problems Solved </u>
The Green Carbon Calculator tackles several critical challenges in promoting digital sustainability. Firstly, it raises awareness among individuals and organizations about the environmental impact of their digital activities, a factor often overlooked. Secondly, it simplifies the complex process of calculating digital carbon emissions, providing users with an accessible tool for estimating their footprint. Additionally, it offers actionable insights and recommendations, empowering users to make greener choices and reduce their environmental impact. By highlighting the consequences of digital activities, the calculator motivates behavioral change towards more sustainable practices. Moreover, it fills a gap in available tools, providing a dedicated solution for assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of digital operations. Through these efforts, the Green Carbon Calculator aims to facilitate informed decision-making and meaningful steps towards a more sustainable digital ecosystem.

# <u> Installation </u>
 > Install virtualenv (if not already installed): You can install virtualenv using pip if you haven't already:
```shell
pip install virtualenv
```
> Create a new directory for your Streamlit project: Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Streamlit project.
> Create a virtual environment: Inside your project directory, run the following command to create a new virtual environment named env:
```shell
virtualenv env
```
> This command will create a new directory named env in your project directory containing a clean Python environment.

> Activate the virtual environment: Before you can use the virtual environment, you need to activate it. On Windows, you activate the virtual environment by running the activate script located in the env\Scripts directory. Run the following command:

``` shell
env\Scripts\activate
```
> You should see (env) at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is now active.

> Install Streamlit in the virtual environment: Now that your virtual environment is activated, you can install Streamlit inside it using pip:

```shell
pip install streamlit
```
This will install Streamlit and any dependencies it requires inside your virtual environment.
